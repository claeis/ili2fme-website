## Installing ili2fme

Please note that Safe Software
distributes the ili2fme format with FME as a convenience.

The [Licensing options](https://www.safe.com/pricing/fme-desktop/) for 
this format begin with FME Desktop Professional Edition.

The methods below are only required, if you want to override the version of ili2fme 
that is distributed by Safe Software.

### by using the MSI file
just double-click the msi file (This will install ili2fme into your current FME software folder)

### by using the ZIP file

To install ili2fme, choose a directory and extract the distribution file there.
Copy the files and subdirectories of "${ili2fme}/FME Suite" to your FME directory.

To use ili2fme with the FME Universal Viewer, FME requires you to set an
environment variable: FME_VIEWER_THREADING=SINGLE.

You may add your commonly used private Interlis models to the directory "${FME}/plugins/interlis2/ilimodels".

## Running ili2fme

ili2fme is called by FME, if you select "Swiss INTERLIS (ili2fme)" as file format.

INTERLIS 2 is read/written if you select xtf or xml as file extension.
INTERLIS 1 is read/written if you select itf as file extension (but you have to select "Swiss INTERLIS (ili2fme)" in FME).
You should read .ili files (INTERLIS 1 or 2) to import feature types into the workbench.
